# Sales-Optimizer-using-Machine-Learning

Dataset contain customers bill receipts, which shows the items purchased by the particular customer and matches the item that are purchased side by side for the maximum times. Apriori model helps to create association rules for that particular items. 

Using Apriori model on dataset of 1000 customers in the grocery store, the owner is likely to optimize the sales. It helps to suggest which items should be placed side by side so that the customer is more likely to buy the item next to it.

The file name apyori contain different rules for matching the items, which can imported as a library in code to find the items that are picked several times in a pair.
